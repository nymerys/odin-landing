# odin-landing
This is is the Landing Page project of the Odin Project Foundations course. Here, I will create an entire webpage to primarily demonstrate the concepts and skills I have developed from Flexbox, as well as other CSS elements. It will serve as the final project of this course before I move onto the last unit of Javascript.

From this project, I have learned the new skills of border-radius, to round the corners of containers and elements, and object-fit, to crop or cover parts of images while retaining their original shapes.
